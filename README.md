This is the to-do-list with the weather information for your location.
When you open it, it will ask you to enable your location sharing or not. By sharing, you can get the weather information.

To-Do-List:
- You can enter what you want to do.
- You can delete the list you wrote.
- Your local storage will remember what you wrote on the to-do lists.
